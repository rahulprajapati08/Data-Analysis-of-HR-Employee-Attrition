# 🧑‍💼 HR Employee Attrition Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project focused on the **HR Employee Attrition** dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and potential factors influencing employee attrition using Python and data visualization libraries.

> This is an ongoing project where I aim to build machine learning models to predict attrition in later stages. So far, I’ve completed a thorough EDA.
